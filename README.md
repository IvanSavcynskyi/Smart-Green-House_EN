Hello! This project is created to facilitate the work of farmers and automate the system of growing agricultural crops.

By using the ESP8266 microcontroller and a hygrometer soil moisture sensor, as well as a sensor for measuring air humidity and temperature, along with some software solutions, we can monitor greenhouses and plants remotely, which greatly simplifies the process.

The system is based on the NodeMCU board with the ESP8266 microcontroller, to which a hygrometer soil moisture sensor and a DHT11 sensor for measuring air humidity and temperature are connected. The controller is connected to a Wi-Fi network and hosts a server that hosts a website for viewing information with an available API. The website is written in HTML and CSS. You can view the data directly from the website or from other sources. Any program can retrieve data from the sensors using the API.

A Telegram bot sends a GET request, processes the received information, saves it to a file for further analysis, and sends it to the user upon the /data command using the PyTelegramAPI module for Python. When the program is opened, Python launches the application through the Chrome browser using the eel library. The interface is created using HTML and CSS, and the bridge between the GUI and the program logic written in Python is JavaScript. On the first tab, you can see the current readings, which are also obtained through the API directly from the website via a request. On the Information tab, you can learn how to take care of a specific plant (in my case, Ficus Benjamina). And on the Charts tab, when selecting a specific category, the program generates a graph using Matplotlib. The data for the graph is retrieved from a file where the Telegram bot has recorded the data. This allows you to analyze and draw conclusions based on the sensor readings near your plant over the entire time period.
