            <h3>What indicators are suitable?</h3>
            <p>
                Ficus Benjamin Care:

Pruning: There are several pruning methods for shaping the crown of the Ficus Benjamin, whether you want it to have a trunk-like form or a bushy shape. Care for Ficus Benjamin in indoor conditions involves:


Flowering: Most people are unaware that Ficus Benjamin is actually a flowering plant. However, when grown indoors, it rarely blooms. Even in its natural habitat or in greenhouse conditions, it produces syconia, which are modified inflorescences that resemble small round peas. If these flowers appear on a weakened plant, it is recommended to remove them, as flowering requires a lot of energy from the plant.


Temperature: Ficus Benjamin is a tropical plant and prefers temperatures between 18-25 degrees Celsius during the summer. In winter, it can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures, but not below 16 degrees Celsius. During ventilation, it is advisable to move the plant to another room.


Humidity: Ficus Benjamin requires increased humidity, so it should be regularly misted with a spray bottle. Pay special attention to misting the leaves during the heating season in winter and on hot summer days. Another way to increase humidity is by placing a tray with pebbles and water underneath the plant pot.


Light: Ficus Benjamin requires bright, indirect sunlight. It thrives best on east or west-facing windowsills. If placed on a south-facing window, it may require some shade from direct sunlight (e.g., using curtains). If grown on a north-facing window, the plant may experience slower growth due to low light levels. For variegated varieties, consider the color patterns on the leaves to determine the optimal lighting conditions. The more prominent the light spots on the leaves, the more intense the light the plant requires. This is because the light areas contain less chlorophyll.


Watering: Pay special attention to watering the Ficus Benjamin. It does not tolerate either dry or waterlogged soil. Only water the plant when the top layer of the substrate has dried out. To check the moisture level, insert your finger into the soil about 30mm deep. If the substrate is dry, it needs to be watered. If only the surface is dry, wait before watering. Avoid overwatering, as it can lead to root rot.


Soil: The nutrient-rich substrate for Ficus Benjamin should consist of components such as sand, leaf and peat soil, and a small amount of charcoal.


Fertilizer: Fertilize Ficus Benjamin from spring to autumn using liquid fertilizer. Apply it to the substrate twice a month. Experienced gardeners recommend alternating between organic and mineral fertilizers.


Repotting: Young Ficus Benjamin plants should be repotted annually, while mature plants can do without repotting. However, the top layer of the substrate (about 30mm) should be replaced each year.


Propagation: Ficus Benjamin can be propagated through stem cuttings, air layering, and seed propagation.

By following these care instructions, you can ensure the healthy growth and development of your Ficus Benjamin plant.</p>
